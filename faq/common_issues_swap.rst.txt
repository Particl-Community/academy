        **A swap is stuck. Can I abandon it?**

     If a swap seems "stuck", simply wait until the atomic swap contract expires. Once it does, you'll be refunded your coins. It is not possible for a swap to remain stuck indefinitely.

     The instructions work for a wide variety of operating system. Make sure that you follow each step carefully and watch out for any error that the terminal returns. 

     **Do not progress move on to the next step if the terminal gives you an error after typing a command**. You need to resolve errors when/if they appear before you can continue, else the installation will not work. The terminal generally does a good job at telling you what went wrong and how to fix it.
