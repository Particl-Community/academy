        **How do I open the marketplace in order to see listings?**

    1. Be sure to be on the latest version (|PD version|). The :doc:`installation guide <../marketplace-guides/marketguides_installation>` guide may help you greatly.
    2. After the initial startup, let the network sync. On slow connections, it may take a while, but you can monitor incoming listings if you head over to the :guilabel:`Browse` page.
    
    Be sure that you don’t see any warnings in the top right status bar. If you still don’t see any listings, feel free to :ref:`Get support`.

        **What does each order status mean?**

    - :guilabel:`ORDER REQUEST`: You have requested an order on an item and are now waiting for the vendor to accept it.
    - :guilabel:`ACCEPTED`: The vendor has accepted your order and is now waiting for you to send the payment and your security deposit in escrow.
    - :guilabel:`ESCROW`: You have locked your funds in escrow and are now waiting for the vendor to lock their security deposit as well.
    - :guilabel:`PACKAGING`: The vendor is now packaging your order and getting it ready to ship.
    - :guilabel:`SHIPPING`: The vendor has shipped your item and is now waiting for you to receive and confirm the delivery.
    - :guilabel:`COMPLETE`: You have received your order and have confirmed the order as "complete". There are no more required actions in this transaction, and you've received your security deposit back.

        **Why am I not getting updates on my orders?**
 
    If your :term:`Particl Desktop` is protected by a password (encrypted), **you need to unlock it with your password** to receive order updates. If you keep your client locked, you won't receive the notifications and won't be able to progress to the next step.

    If your order is still not updated after unlocking your client, that's because the seller hasn't done it yet. Wait for the vendor to update the order, or try leaving them a message in the :guilabel:`Chat` section of your order!

        **Why do I need to pay twice the value of the order I'm purchasing?**
 
    That's because you need to fund the escrow contract with a security deposit equal to the total value of your order. This deposit will be refunded to you at no fee once the transaction is fully completed. 

    To learn more about Particl's two-party escrow system, head over to the :doc:`Two-Party Escrow System guide<../particl-marketplace/marketplace_escrow>`.

        **Can anyone else other than the seller see my shipping address and communications?**
 
    No. Only the seller can access your shipping details and private chat conversations because they are end-to-end encrypted before they are broadcast to the network. Check out our :doc:`marketplace privacy guide <../particl-marketplace/marketplace_privacy>` to learn more about data security. 

    Note that, contrary to private in-order discussions, public questions and answers posted in a listing's :guilabel:`Chat` section are publicly displayed.

        **How can I directly contact a seller?**

    You can leave a comment in a listing's :guilabel:`Chat` section. This will notify the seller that they've received a message and they'll be able to answer you. Keep in mind that a listing's :guilabel:`Chat` section is public, meaning all messages you and the seller leaves in there are publicly visible.

    Alternatively, you may contact a seller in private once you open an order with them. A private chat window is accessible in :guilabel:`Purchases` as well as in the :guilabel:`Chat Messages` section.

        **Where can I find the tracking number of one of my orders?**

    When a seller leaves you a tracking number, you can check it out right from your Particl Desktop client. To do so, head over to the :guilabel:`Orders` page of the :guilabel:`SELL` section. Find the order that you want to find the tracking number of and click on its tile to expand its details.

    A seller may not always leave a tracking number, but when they do, that's where you'll find it!

        **How can I cancel an order?**

    It's only possible to cancel an order if the seller hasn't accepted it yet. Otherwise, you can try reaching out to the seller by their provided contact information or through the order's :guilabel:`Chat` section to reach an agreement.
