        **I can't find the marketplace on Particl Desktop**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|. 

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        **No listing is showing up on the marketplace (empty marketplace)**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|. 
    - Check if in the top right corner the :guilabel:`peers` icon is a red circle. If it's the case, check your firewall settings. The :term:`Particl Desktop` client is not able to contact the network. Make sure your internet connection is available at all.
    - Leave :term:`Particl Desktop` open for a few minutes so that it can sync the blockchain and load the market data. This can take several minutes and tends to take longer on slow internet connections.
    - Reset your market database by first making a copy of your ``particl-market`` folder and then deleting it (**don't delete the backup copy**). Keep in mind this is a last resort solution. It will permanently remove all your market-related data such as current orders, listings, order history, and etc. **Make sure that you do not have any active order before doing this step, or you will permanently lose access to the escrow contracts.**

        **I can't publish a listing**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|. 
    - Make sure you have enough PART in your public or private balance to cover the listing fees.

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        **I can't publish a listing** - Notice: "Error fetching the fee estimate during publishing"

    Make sure your PART balance in “Public” or "Anon" state has enough UXTO splits. (mind the privacy state; In a default setup you go with "Public")

    #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Wallet` app via the left handed side-navigation menu -> Select the marketplace's wallet
    #. Open the :guilabel:`SEND / CONVERT` module
    #. Use the UXTO splitter slider to set a mid range amount and send some coins to yourself.

    You should now be able to publish your listing.

        **"Message did not send" error when trying to list multiple items at once**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|.
    - Scroll down to the bottom of the page and republish the listings that couldn't be sent in a :term:`SecureMessaging (SMSG)` message. You may need to repeat that step a few times until all items are published.

        **The escrow process is jammed. Neither the buyer or seller can progress further**

    On rare occasions, the :term:`SecureMessaging (SMSG)` network can encounter message propagation issues. This can lead to issues such as the escrow system not progressing further even when both transacting parties complete the escrow steps. To fix that issue, you can manually resend messages to the other party.

	 	#. Find the order you want to fix in the ``Orders`` tab of the ``SELL`` page.
	 	#. Note down the order's ID.
	 	#. Open the Debug console window by clicking on its icon at the top right corner of your :term:`Particl Desktop` client.
	 	#. Click on the ``Market`` tab and enter the following command by replacing ``<ID>`` with the order ID you've just noted down.
	 		``orderitem history <id>``
	 	#. This will give you a lot of data about the order. Copy everything and paste it into a text document to better search for the data you need to continue further. 
	 	#. Note down the ``<msgid>`` values you need for the next step.
	 		- If your buyer has successfully locked its funds in escrow, but you're not getting that notification and can't progress further, then you need to note down two ``msgid`` values: **MPA_COMPLETE** and **MPA_SHIP**.
	 		- If you've sent the item to your buyer, but he hasn't received that notification and can't confirm that he has received the item, then you only need to note down the **MPA_SHIP** ``<msgid>`` value.
	 	#. Run the following command(s) in :term:`Particl Desktop`'s Debug window for each ``<msgid>`` value you've noted down (**MPA_COMPLETE** first, then **MPA_SHIP**).
	 		``smsg resent <msgid>``

	 		- If you have successfully locked your funds (payment + security deposit) in escrow, but the seller isn't getting that notification and can't progress further, then you need to note down the ``msgid`` value of **MPA_LOCK**.
	 	#. Run the following command in :term:`Particl Desktop`'s Debug window by replacing ``<msgid>`` with the value of **MPA_LOCK**.
