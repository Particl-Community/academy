        **I can't find the marketplace on Particl Desktop**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|.

        **No listing is showing up on the marketplace (empty marketplace)**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|. 
    - Check if in the top right corner the :guilabel:`peers` icon is a red circle. If it's the case, :term:`Particl Desktop` is not able to connect the network. Check your firewall settings and add an exception for Particl Desktop, and make sure your internet connection is available at all.
    - Leave :term:`Particl Desktop` open for a few minutes so that it can sync the :term:`blockchain <blockchain>` and load the :term:`market <Market>` data. This can take several minutes and tends to take longer on slow internet connections.

        **I can't publish a listing**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|. 
    - Make sure you have enough PART in your public or private balance to cover the listing fees.

        **I can't publish a listing** - Notice: "Error fetching the fee estimate during publishing"

    Make sure your PART balance in “Public” or "Anon" state has enough UXTO splits.

    #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Wallet` app via the left handed side-navigation menu -> Select the marketplace's wallet
    #. Open the :guilabel:`SEND / CONVERT` module
    #. Use the UXTO splitter slider to set a mid range amount and send some coins to yourself.

    You should now be able to publish listings.

        **"Message did not send" error when trying to list multiple items at once**

    - Make sure you are using |PD version|.
    - Scroll down to the bottom of the page and republish the listings that couldn't be sent in a :term:`SecureMessaging (SMSG)` message. You may need to repeat that step a few times until all items are published.
