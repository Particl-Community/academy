        **How can I edit or delete a listing after it has been published?**

    Due to the current stage of development of the :term:`Particl Marketplace` (Beta), it is currently not possible. If you want to change the description or image of an item, please publish a new listing. 

    This functionality is plan to be added at a later stage.

        **For how long do listings stay on the marketplace?**

    That's all up to you! The expiry time for listings on the marketplace depends on the listing fee you pay. When publishing one or multiple listings, the :term:`Particl Desktop` client will prompt you to select the number of days you want your listings to be published. Simply choose the number of days you prefer from the dropdown menu, and you're all set!

        **How can I republish listings after they've expired?**

    Go to the :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` tab of the :guilabel:`SELL` page and find the template of the listing you want to republish. Click on it to display more options and click on the publishing icon (rocket) next to the market(s) or storefront(s) you want to publish your listing in. You can publish the same listing in many different markets.

    Alternatively, you can instead click on the :guilabel:`Batch (Re)publish...` button on the same page to open up the publishing tool. On there, you can publish multiple listings at once on any :term:`market or storefront <Market>` in which you have publishing rights.

        **How can I reply to a question left on one of my listings?**

    Go to your marketplace :guilabel:`Overview` page and look for the :guilabel:`New questions` and :guilabel:`New answers` tiles. Clicking on them will bring you to the right page and show you all outstanding questions and replies.

        **Why does my product show up in "Reported listings", and what does it mean?**

    If one of your listings shows up in the *Reported listings* section, it means at least one person has flagged it as inappropriate. If enough people do the same, it will be taken off the marketplace entirely. If your listing shows up in the reported listings section but still shows up on the marketplace, it means that not enough people have voted to delete it.

        **Why do listing fees vary between items?**

    Listing fees are determined by two dynamic factors â€” the expiry time of the listing and its size (measured in kb). If you publish your listing for a long time, or if it contains many pictures and a large description, it will be more expensive to list than a smaller listing in comparison.

        **Why am I not receiving any new buy orders?**
 
    If your :term:`Particl Desktop` client is protected by a password (encrypted), **you need to unlock it** so that it can pick up new orders from the :term:`Particl network <Particl network>`. If you keep your client locked, you won't receive any new orders now will you get updates from your currently active ones.

        **How can I send a tracking number or note to my customer?**

    Once you mark an order as :guilabel:`SHIPPED` (:ref:`Package and Shipping an Order`), your :term:`Particl Desktop` client will prompt you to enter a tracking number or note to your customer. It's an entirely optional step, but it helps your customers keep track of their order(s).

    You can also securely leave that information to the customer in the :guilabel:`Chat` section of each individual order located in the :guilabel:`SELL` page.

        **How can I cancel an order?**

    You can only cancel an order you haven't yet accepted. To do so, head over to the :guilabel:`SELL` page and click on the tile of the order you want to cancel. On there, you will find a :guilabel:`Cancel` button.

    Due to the current stage of development of the :term:`Particl Marketplace` (Beta), it's currently not possible to cancel an order once you have fully locked your security deposit in escrow.
