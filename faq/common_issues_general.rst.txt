        **Coins not showing up when receiving an anon payment**

    When you hold or receive coins in either blind or anon balances, the balances aren't displayed on your :term:`Particl Desktop` until you unlock it. This is a security measure.

    #. Make sure the payment was sent to the blockchain. 

        Check the transaction on the `Particl blockchain explorer <https://explorer.particl.io>`_ . 

    #. Make sure the receiving wallet is unlocked.

        Click on the :guilabel:`Vault Icon` in the top right corner.

    #. Make sure the receiving wallet's blockchain is in sync.

        Open the :guilabel:`Debug Console` in the bottom left corner and enter the command :code:`getblockchaininfo` then compare the chain height output to the `Particl blockchain explorer status <https://explorer.particl.io/status>`_
