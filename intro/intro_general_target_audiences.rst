The Particl project, as a decentralized organization, holds itself to strong priciples of liberty and freedom - naturally, privacy is at the very core of this vision. Those values are uncompromisingly reflected by its community and userbase, as well as in the properties of the Particl privacy coin and the entirely private and decentralized marketplace. 

Particl empowers and stands for fairness for consumers, equal opportunity for merchants and vendors, and freedom for all people! To that effect, it aims to directly support individuals and small businesses all across the world, instead of corporations, and independently of government regulation.

In Dire Need
------------

**For those in need of a trustless, peer-to-peer trade and commerce environment**

Customers can rarely be 100% sure that they will receive the goods and services they’ve bought with the agreed specifications and quality. Likewise, suppliers sometimes encounter problems getting full payments for goods they deliver. This contractual insecurity applies to almost any industry: too often, both parties end up being left with a waste of time, money, and confidence.

Another example is the not-so-known problem of exit-scam schemes - where money gets put into third-party escrow services with the deepest belief of a safe business transaction, but with an unfortunate and costly outcome due to clever trickery against the escrow system from the other party.

Particl marketplace's sophisticated two-party escrow mechanism works to prevent those outcomes, with absolutely no compromise to the promise of a decentralized, trustless market environment.

*“We help you to build, enable, and maintain safe and trustless business and commerce relationships.“*

**For those in need for privacy in e-commerce, from start to finish**

It used to be that any commercial transaction made with cash was inherently private - a rapidly eroding concept ever since the internet came to be. Instead, modern e-commerce platforms actively work on cannibalizing their users for their own benefits. They trace and invade their successful vendors’ supply chains, put pressure on the suppliers, and copy trending or popular products. They can then sell the copied products with their own branding, while suppressing or reducing the original vendor’s exposure within their commerce platform. You may know one of the most famous online marketplaces in the world, which is entirely powered by this predatory behavior. Something to do with the word "Basics".

The uncompromising privacy of :term:`Particl Marketplace` helps you protect yourself from data leaks and abuses, spam, and unwanted solicitations. It ensures that nobody can track you, create invasive customer profiles of your habits without your knowledge and consent, or even steal your identity or business. The PART privacy coin ensures that all settlements remain entirely private and untrackable, and is integral to this vision.

*“We help you prevent others from turning your success into a weapon to be used against you.“*

----

**For all who suffer from oppression and restrictions in e-commerce**

Still to this day, there are regions where political oppression and censorship are the status quo. Those citizens need a solution that delivers to them a way to do commerce freely — a human right — without being persecuted.

This problem is spreading globally and is not limited to countries deemed as authoritarian anymore. Tech giants censor individuals, businesses, or specific content that doesn't fit their agenda, leading to an ever-increasing online liberty crisis.

Anyone can barter anything on the Particl market - with no registration, no identification and no restriction.

*“We help you to buy and sell what you want, when you want, and wherever you want, in the face of all resistance.“*

----

**For those in need of an e-commerce solution where no banking account is required**

According to the World Bank, 1.7 billion adult people on planet earth are unbanked. But you can bet they are interested in doing business - especially in their local or immediate area. Particl offers itself as an alternative for person-to-person payments and for the storing of wealth: two things integral to commerce.

What’s more, using financial services that don’t rely on the banking system undoubtedly gives you the maximum level of financial independence and freedom. Traditional banking is, now more than ever, being put into question; and blockchain technology enables a radical reshaping of it.

*“We aim to radically rethink our need for traditional banking.“*

----

**For those making in-person deals**

Suppose, for example, that you buy a piece of jewelry directly from a stranger - this could be while using Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, or any similar local person-to-person solution. How do you make sure you don’t get scammed? How do you ensure the quality, material, or stone is as promised? There are many things that can go wrong with this type of transaction.

:term:`Particl Marketplace`’s unique two-party escrow system makes it possible to safely trade with anyone, online or in-person, even if you don’t know them. It replaces the simple but unsafe in-person cash-for-item exchanges, and the uncertainty of transacting with a stranger without any form of leverage against them to enforce honesty. 

*“We help you enforce truthful and honest trades with your business partners regardless if that’s online or in-person.“*

----

**For those looking for the absolute bare minimum in fees and operating costs**

On :term:`Particl Marketplace`, the absence of commissions, sales fees, subscription models, and other operating costs encourages brands, vendors, suppliers, and even small retailers with their local businesses. It allows them to thrive within an entirely self-sufficient, circular, global, and community-led economy.

Other so-called “free” e-commerce marketplaces and solutions take advantage of you with a myriad of fees - and, even worse, with your data, habits, and personal information. Did you know that, depending on various factors, e-commerce platforms like Amazon can charge their sellers up to 40% more per transaction? Don’t think that’s not reflected in retail prices!

The only operating costs you will see on :term:`Particl Marketplace` are tiny listing fees, designed to fight off spam and unintentional usage. 

*“We help your business and customers get the best deals possible.“*

Fair Economics
--------------

Driven by sensible economic motivations, customers and vendors always seek the best deals out there. To the benefit of both buyers and sellers, Particl marketplace eliminates the corporate interests of a marketplace operator from the pricing model; nearly anybody can see the potential impact that can have on retail prices. 

Retailers, merchants, and vendors, in general, looking for new target customer groups, sales channels, and revenue streams will find exactly what they’re after in Particl marketplace: an opportunity to offer their products at even more competitive prices. At the same time, they get rid of many problems usually associated with typical e-commerce solutions and payment processors: they now get near-instant and chargeback-proof payments, without any retention times, that cannot arbitrarily be held or frozen.

The ability to create private markets, coupled with the absence of operating costs, makes it attractive for cooperatives to set up their own and dedicated sales channel and gain exposure from a bigger public audience, or just towards a defined local VIP group of customers.

Ultimately, it’s in your best interest to lead your existing customers to understand the benefits of better prices. It lets you enjoy the full range of advantages of economic advancement as an individual, a collective, or as a business.

*“We help you reduce your e-commerce costs to the absolute minimum.“*

To Take a Stand
---------------

Using :term:`Particl Marketplace` is an efficient and effortless way to take a radical stance towards banking and the world of finance in general - but it empowers more than just private transactions.

For example, the sustainability movement pays special attention to not wasting resources and protecting them. This ranges from agricultural products and their production to adequately treated and remunerated workforces.

There are also groups like the libertarians, a reasonably sized community, with strong privacy imperatives. They seek autonomy, political freedom, self-determination and  constantly question the current economic and political systems. They care about our society, like most groups, and have their own vision of what that means.

Ultimately, the common denominator relates to the concepts of abusive surveillance, censorship, monopolies, banking, and data gathering operations that prey on honest and caring people. The Particl ecosystem was designed with a view to empower resistance against all of those things, unconditionally, and regardless of any other factors.


*“We help the caring society to take a stand and to express and achieve ideas for a better, fairer world.“*
