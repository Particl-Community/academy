   :description lang=en: Learn everything about Particl and its privacy-first applications. Bringing privacy to Web3.

Particl is a user-friendly and developer-friendly ecosystem of privacy-first decentralized applications building against the centralization of power and services on the web. 

United under the mission of shifting the balance of power from corporate monopolies back to the people, Particl contributors built a privacy-first and modular ecosystem of decentralized applications complemented by a native privacy coin to send and receive untraceable currency payments within smart contracts. 

These dApps — alternative versions of some of the online services and products we use every day — are designed to operate in complete and total privacy and without intermediaries or restrictions. 

Particl Academy provides documentation on some of the Particl ecosystem’s key components, its privacy-centric cryptocurrency PART, and the various dApps currently in development or production.
