:term:`Particl Marketplace` is a platform that lets you buy and sell goods and services online privately, with no middleman. There is no centralized entity operating, controlling, or benefiting from the marketplace.

Unlike Amazon and other traditional marketplace platforms, :term:`Particl Marketplace` and the PART privacy coin are built with security and privacy principles at their core. It enables you, as either a buyer or a seller, to keep your identity and data safe at all times.

The Particl project aims to make available advanced and intuitive blockchain technologies that empower you in accomplishing online transactions privately and with no middleman, to the benefit of your communities and to the detriment of the centralized entities that prey on them.

**The world has changed. It calls for us to stand for our liberties and future.**

* :ref:`Protect your assets <Protect Your Assets>` and keep extra money for what matters in your life. 
* :ref:`Stand for liberty <Stand For Liberty>` and stop being the exploited product.
* :ref:`Squash the rogues <Squash The Rogues>`, and stop the scammers.
* :ref:`Contribute to society <Contribute To Society>` when you buy and sell online.

.. note:: 
	 Particl Marketplace relies on open-source technologies openly audited, inspected, and improved by a global community. It is based on distributed ledger and peer-to-peer technologies. It runs on a network of independent nodes hosted by volunteers scattered across the world. The entirely autonomous platform doesn’t require any central party to operate or maintain, which means no company or organization is between buyers and sellers.

----

Protect Your Assets
-------------------

:term:`Particl Marketplace` does not seek revenues from selling off your data or through fees. It doesn’t need that data and income because there is no corporate interest behind it. Instead, main contributors working on Particl are supported entirely by community donations, without any strings attached or compromise for you. This brings down the total cost of doing online commerce.

The Particl marketplace and its privacy coin also shields your identity and personal information at all times — unlike traditional marketplaces where you pay with your personal information and data on top of commissions and fees.


*“We help you to save more and make more money by cutting out the middleman.“*

----

Stand For Liberty
-----------------

Big corporations collect data from you with every purchase and sale you make. They even do it the second you land on their website and start browsing. They use your data to analyze your behaviors as an online merchant, or a consumer, and increase their bottom line. Then, they sell your personal information or use it against you without your knowledge or consent. Our data have become the product and huge corporations are the insidious thieves.

The ever-sprawling giant e-commerce corporations always seek to expand their profits, market power, and control. They have created today’s alarming digital security and privacy crisis under the guise of usability and convenience. And with all the information they possess, they've become more powerful than some national governments - although completely at the mercy of the regulations and intelligence agencies of others. Now more than ever, protecting your data means protecting your liberty and finances.

*“We help you to become the captain of your data and liberties.“*

----

Squash The Rogues
-----------------

**You Stop Privacy Invasions and Backdoors** 

When no data about you is created, it cannot be collected by anyone - and when no one collects it, it cannot be shared, sold, misused, hacked, or leaked anymore. That means no stolen credit card information or passwords, compromised online accounts, or online surveillance.

That’s true for sellers and buyers regardless of whether it relates to your products, locations, payments, shipping information, preferences, or any online activity. Part of the Particl vision is to empower everyone's human right to privacy and provide a shield from the many technical and political uncertainties of today’s world.

*“We help you become invincible to privacy issues.”*

**You Stop Restrictions, Politics, and Malice**

:term:`Particl Marketplace` has a 100% uptime, and cannot be taken offline or manipulated. No merchant, buyer, or product can be banned, censored, or canceled by centralized authorities or corporations. In its stead, :doc:`the Particl community is in charge <in-depth/indepth_mp_moderation>` of what content is allowed to be publicly displayed on the marketplace. Across national borders, you can now enjoy free trade and free-market conditions without the interference of governing bodies. We empower manufacturers, vendors, and producers to freely decide how and with whom they do business.

*“We help you become bullet-proof against unfair restrictions.”*

**Stop and Prevent Fraud by Cutting Off the Middleman**

Fraudulent actions get taken down with a free of charge and automated two-party escrow system. Situations like chargebacks for vendors due to stolen identities, or counterfeit/missing goods for you as a customer are prevented and stopped, with no centralized authority to make it happen. Learn more about our two-party escrow system :doc:`here <in-depth/indepth_escrow>`. 

*“We help you to become immune to online fraud and scammers.”*

**You Stop Spam and Unwanted Solicitations**

Say goodbye to invasive ads hammering on you even after making a purchase, and, most of the time, before you even make it. You see them on the websites you visit, you encounter them throughout your emails, and directly on the apps you use. They even affect how search engines deliver results to you. They follow you wherever you go and, every day, crawl deeper into your life, but now you can get rid of them by not providing marketers the data they need to harass you.

*“We help you to put an end to spam.”*

Contribute To Society
---------------------

E-commerce and online marketplaces have made the world of shopping and selling a very different place. The price wars destroyed small merchants only to benefit online platform operators and financial services providers. As a result, many small businesses have given up as a handful of large corporations continue to dominate the market. The ones who suffer the most are the low-to-middle-class people - the heart of every nation throughout the world.

**Pledge to Small Merchants, Manufacturers, and Producers**

Breaking the online monopolies gives merchants, manufacturers, and producers of goods and services the ability to build a livelihood that no longer depends on middlemen and large corporations' interests.

**Pledge to Local Shops and Co-operatives**

Local shops and co-operatives in your community get the ability to set up their own internet shops at virtually no cost, no maintenance requirement, and without any external interference or oversight.

**Pledge to Yourself and your Communities**

Sustainability and responsibility are the cornerstones of a healthy economy. Don’t wait for somebody to make the economy better; be your own revolution and liberation. Share and discuss :term:`Particl Marketplace` with your communities and help empower sellers reach customers around the world privately and efficiently.

*“Particl empowers individuals and communities to combat global regulations and competitive disadvantages.”*

How it Works
-------------

:term:`Particl Marketplace` relies on open-source technologies that are openly audited, inspected, and improved by the global community. Each and every single component of the marketplace is designed to keep you, your funds, and your personal information safe.

It is based on :term:`distributed ledger <Distributed Ledger>` and :term:`peer-to-peer <Peer-to-Peer>` technologies, which you may know by hearing :term:`Blockchain` and Bitcoin's synonyms.

It is an entirely autonomous platform that doesn’t require any central party to operate, which means no company or organization is between buyers and sellers.
