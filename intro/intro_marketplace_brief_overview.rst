General Usage and Concept
-------------------------

The :term:`Particl Marketplace` enables an easy and cost-effective shopping platform that makes zero compromise to the core values of :term:`decentralization <Decentralization>`, :doc:`security, privacy <../in-depth/indepth_privacy_tips>`, and :term:`disintermediation <Disintermediation>`. The PART privacy coin is integral to this and is endowed with powerful privacy features.

.. note::

	A web and a mobile version of :term:`Particl Marketplace` are planned to be released later on and will play a key role in making the platform more accessible and convenient to use.

----

Payment Processing
------------------

For technical reasons and in order to ensure anonymity and untraceability, transactions on the :term:`Particl Marketplace` are settled exclusively in :doc:`PART <../in-depth/indepth_part_coin>`, Particl's native digital currency. 

.. note::

	Payments with local, national currencies (i.e., USD, EUR) will be integrated later on. They will play a key role in making the platform even more accessible and convenient to use.

----

Fraud Protection
----------------

Any purchase you make on the marketplace is secured by a :doc:`two-party escrow system <../in-depth/indepth_escrow>` that keeps you and your money safe without requiring any third-party. This eliminates contingencies that centralized markets suffer from, such as the possibility of exit scams or of escrow funds falling prey to a hacker or the bias of the arbitror and his policies.

:term:`Particl Marketplace` not only does away with fees - it also gives you valuable security and privacy benefits while being entirely decentralized. These perks come at a cost: it takes :ref:`three more steps <Step-by-Step Process>` than usual for customers to complete a purchase in full.

These three additional steps are necessary to complete the 2-party escrow system that enables a truly decentralized marketplace. 

.. note::

	We are constantly improving the software and its user experience. Eventually, we also want to get rid of these extra steps.

Community Markets
-----------------

On :term:`Particl Marketplace`, you can deploy as many :doc:`shops and markets <../guides/guide_mp_general_market_management>` as you wish. Markets can be publicly available and even advertised, or kept secret between a few individuals. Creators of those :term:`community markets <Community Market>` remain in complete control of their associated contents, their level of privacy, and accessibility. 

Community markets can be created for almost any purpose as there is no central censorship authority.

----

Content Moderation
------------------

As everyone and no one owns the :term:`Particl Marketplace`, every participant has the equal ability to flag and potentially hide undesirable content from the public. 

When enough people flag a listing as inappropriate, it will be taken off the public market. Flagging a listing will also take it off your local version of the marketplace to prevent you from seeing it again. 

Achieving content moderation on a decentralized e-commerce platform is complex but worth it, and we invite you to read more about it by clicking the link below.
