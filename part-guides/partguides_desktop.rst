   :description lang=en: Overview of the main functions of the Particl Desktop client. 

Particl Desktop is Particl’s main desktop client, and the preferred access gateway into the :term:`Particl ecosystem <Particl ecosystem>`. It enables access to some of the various privacy-first dApps, acts as the go-to PART wallet, and allows users to vote on and track DAO proposals. 

While Particl contributors are working on alternative gateways to access and interact with the Particl ecosystem and its privacy-first dApps (i.e., web, mobile), Particl Desktop is the most secure, private, and :term:`decentralized <Decentralized>` access point available.

        **Address Book (Contacts)**

    Because funds need to be sent to cryptographic addresses, it can be hard to remember who owns which address. Particl Desktop’s address book page is there specifically to let you label PART addresses to contacts.

    - Save both public and private PART addresses and enter their contact information.
    - Display a contact’s address and all of its details in a block explorer.
    - Sign and verify messages using PART addresses.
    - When sending funds to one of your contacts, you can quickly pick their address from the address book.

Market
------

The "Market" section of the :term:`Particl Desktop` client is the main access gateway for the Particl marketplace dApp. It allows you to browse items available on the market, manage your own inventory of products and listings, join additional markets and storefronts, and review your buy orders and sell orders. It is the first dApp to be integrated fully within the Particl Desktop client.
