   :description lang=en: Learn how to enable staking for Particlâ€™s native privacy coin. Proof-of-Stake and cold staking the easy way.

Simply by keeping an open connection to the :term:`Particl Blockchain`, you automatically earn a yearly staking interest rate of at least 4% on the total number of PART coins you hold in your public balance.

Staking also grants you the ability to vote on various community proposals, using your staking power as voting power.

Enabling staking is generally straightforward, but some of the staking solutions available on Particl may require more work to set up. This user guide will walk you through the process of enabling any of these solutions without too much hassle.

.. note:: 

    **Prerequisites**

    - A :term:`Particl Desktop` wallet containing more than 0 PART.
    - PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance.
    - An active internet connection.
    - A separate device to convert into a staking :term:`node <Node>` (required for cold staking only).

There are multiple ways you can stake your PART coins. Each of these solutions has pros and cons as well as its own method of activation. 

Enable Staking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regular staking
---------------

Activating regular staking is the fastest method to get started. All it requires you to do is open up the :term:`Particl Desktop` client and "unlock your wallet for staking only". Regular staking, however, requires your computer to be open and connected to the internet 24/7. 

**Non-password protected client**

.. rst-class:: bignums

    #. Launch your :term:`Particl Desktop` client and make sure you have PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance.

That's all. Staking is working as long as your :term:`node <Node>` remains online.

**Password protected client**

.. rst-class:: bignums

    #. Launch your :term:`Particl Desktop` client and make sure you have PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance.
    #. Click the :guilabel:`Padlock` icon at the top right corner of your client.
    #. Click on the downward-facing arrow next to :guilabel:`Additional unlock options` in the overlay window.
    #. Check the :guilabel:`Unlock for staking only` box.
    #. Enter your password and click the :guilabel:`Unlock wallet` button. 

Cold staking
------------

Cold staking is a more advanced, secure, and flexible staking option. It requires you to have a separate device that can remain connected to the internet at all times. This can be a hardware device like a `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/>`_, but it can also be a `VPS or a cloud server <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server>`_ (i.e., DigitalOcean, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.). 

**On your staking device...**

Choose what device you want to use as a staking :term:`node <Node>` (i.e., `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/>`_) and install a Linux (i.e., `Raspbian <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>`_) distribution on it.

.. rst-class:: bignums

    #. Choose what device you want to use as a staking :term:`node <Node>` (i.e., `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/>`_) and install a Linux (i.e., `Raspbian <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>`_) distribution on it.

    #. Install dependencies and download Particl's cold staking app; Partyman.

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo apt-get install python git unzip pv jq dnsutils netcat-openbsd curl

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/dasource/partyman

    #. Install :term:`Particl Core` on your staking device.

        .. code-block:: bash

         partyman/partyman install

        If you already have :term:`Particl Core` installed, update it. 

        .. code-block:: bash

         partyman/partyman update

    #. Once Particl Core is installed, restart Partyman.

        .. code-block:: bash

            partyman/partyman restart now

    #. Create a new Particl wallet on your staking :term:`node <Node>`.

        .. code-block:: bash

            partyman/partyman stakingnode init

    #. Create a new staking public key. It will let you connect your PART coins to the staking :term:`node <Node>`.

        .. code-block:: bash

            partyman/partyman stakingnode new

        Note or copy this staking public key. You will need it for the next steps.

**On Particl Desktop...**

.. rst-class:: bignums

    #. Make sure you have PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance.
    #. In the Wallet module of :term:`Particl Desktop`, navigate to the :guilabel:`Overview` page.
    #. Click on the downward-facing arrow in the :guilabel:`Cold staking` widget on the right of your screen.
    #. Click on the blue :guilabel:`Set up cold staking` button to enter your staking public key in the designated space and confirm with a click on the :guilabel:`Enable cold staking` button.
    
            - Enter your password when prompted to.
    #. To fully activate cold staking, click on the :guilabel:`Zap` button to instantly bring the progress bar to 100%.

**A few cold staking settings...**

There are a few cold staking settings that you can set up. To do so, go back to your staking :term:`node <Node>` and enter the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    ## View your staking statistics.
    partyman/partyman stakingnode stats

    ## Send your staking rewards to any PART address (public balance) of your choice.
    partyman/partyman stakingnode rewardaddress

    ## Configure your marketplace fee preference (more about this setting `here <https://particl.news/adjusting-listing-fees-4b676e230601>`_).
    partyman/partyman stakingnode smsgfeeratetarget

    ##Create secure firewall rules that only allow the required ports to connect to the internet.
    partyman/partyman firewall

Connect to a staking pool
-------------------------

Another way to stake your PART coins is to team with other stakers and combine your staking power. This will give you more frequent but smaller staking rewards. To do so, you need to connect your Particl wallet to a staking pool. 

+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Pool Name                | URL/IP                                   | Pool Fees |
+==========================+==========================================+===========+
| **ColdStakingPool**      | https://coldstakingpool.com/             | 2.5%      |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
| **Crymel's Pool**        | https://particl.crymel.icu/              | 2.50%     |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
| **Particl Page**         | http://161.35.82.61:900/                 | 2.5%      |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+
| **CoinRollin**           | https://coinroll.in/                     | 1%        |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+-----------+

    #. Choose the staking pool you want to use from the list above, open its website, and copy the pool's staking address. (It should look something like ``pcs19453kf98kz47yktqv7x36j39xa07mtvqx8evse``).
    #. Open up your :term:`Particl Desktop` client and make sure you have PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` balance.
    #. In the Wallet module of :term:`Particl Desktop`, navigate to the :guilabel:`Overview` page.
    #. Click on the downward-facing arrow in the :guilabel:`Cold staking` widget on the right of your screen.
    #. Click on the blue :guilabel:`Set up cold staking` button to enter your staking public key in the designated space and confirm with a click on the :guilabel:`Enable cold staking` button.
    
            - Enter your password when prompted to.
    #. To fully activate cold staking, click on the :guilabel:`Zap` button to instantly bring the progress bar to 100%.
            
            - Enter your password when prompted to.

.. Enable hardware staking
.. -----------------------

.. "Hardware staking" refers to the act of staking funds stored on a hardware device like a `Ledger Nano S <https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s>`_ or a `Trezor <https://trezor.io/>`_. The activation process is more technically advanced and requires you to use a different Particl client (Particl-Qt). This step-by-step guide assumes you already know how to use Particl on your hardware device and how to deposit funds on it.

.. On a Ledger Nano S device...
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: bignums

..     #. Set up your `Ledger Nano device <https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007687153-Particl-PART->`_ and store funds into it.
    #. Set up a :ref:`Cold staking` :term:`node <Node>` and copy its public key or copy the public key of a staking pool :ref:`Staking Pools` into your clipboard.
    #. Download and install the latest **Particl-Qt** client `here <https://particl.io/downloads>`_.
    #. Open and unlock Particl-Qt, plug your Ledger Nano device into your computer and make sure it is ready to transact.
    #. Open the Staking setup window by going in :guilabel:`Window` > :guilabel:`Staking Setup`.
    #. Enter your staking :term:`node <Node>`'s public key in the :guilabel:`Cold staking change address` field and enable staking by clicking on the :guilabel:`Apply` button.

.. **To fully activate hardware staking, you need to "zap" your coins.**

.. rst-class:: bignums

..     #. Close Particl-Qt and open :term:`Particl Desktop`.
    #. Navigate to the wallet's :guilabel:`Overview` page located at the top of the left sidebar.
    #. Click on the :guilabel:`Zap` button to instantly bring the progress bar to 100%.

Mobile staking
--------------

It's also possible to stake PART coins stored on a mobile wallet such as `Particl Copay <https://particl.io/downloads/>`_. Staking on your phone is completely secure and requires you to delegate the staking power of your coins to a staking :term:`node <Node>`. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

    #. Set up a :ref:`cold staking` :term:`node <Node>` and copy its public key, or copy the public key of a staking pool into your clipboard.
    #. Download and install the `Particl Copay <https://particl.io/downloads/>`_ mobile application, open it, create a new Particl wallet, and send PART coins to it.
    #. After your coins are deposited into this wallet, tap on the :guilabel:`Staking` icon at the bottom right corner of the screen, followed by a tap on the :guilabel:`Setup Cold Staking` green button.
    #. Enter the staking public key in the designated space and give it a label.
    #. Tap on the :guilabel:`Enable Cold Staking` green button, then tap the :guilabel:`Zap` button to finalize the staking setup process.

Adjust Staking Privacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you operate your own staking :term:`node <Node>`, you can adjust your level of staking privacy. By default, the network sends your staking rewards in your :guilabel:`Public` balance, meaning all your staking rewards are publicly displayed on the blockchain. Particl allows you to change that to increase your financial privacy.

- :guilabel:`Public` balance: Staking rewards are fully transparent and public on the blockchain.
- :guilabel:`Blind` balance: The number of PART coins contained in each reward remains confidential.
- :guilabel:`Anon` balance: The number of PART coins AND your deposit address remain entirely anonymous. This is the highest level of staking privacy possible on the Particl network.

.. rst-class:: bignums

    #. Access your staking :term:`node <Node>` and install the Private Staking script.

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/GBen1/Private-Coldstaking.git

    #. Open the script's directory and launch the script and go through the setup process.

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd ~/Private-Coldstaking && ./privatecoldstaking.sh

    #. Choose the type of balance you'd like to receive your staking rewards in, and copy the new staking public key provided by the script.
    
    #. Verify that the script has been activated and properly set up.

        .. code-block:: bash

            ./update.sh

    #. In your :term:`Particl Desktop` client, navigate to the Wallet module's :guilabel:`Overview` page and enter the public key in the cold staking widget. If you already have cold staking enabled, you will need to disable cold staking first.

If you want to uninstall the script, enter this command.

        .. code-block:: bash

            cd ~/Private-Colstaking && ./uninstall.sh
