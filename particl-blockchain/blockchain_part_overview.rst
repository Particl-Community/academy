What is PART?
-------------

PART is a Proof-of-Stake privacy coin based on the most recent Bitcoin code (currently |BTC Version|) and enhanced with several privacy-preserving protocols. It enables users to make fast, secure, borderless, and private payments without requiring any third-party like banks or payment processors. 

Unlike most privacy coins, it provides solid privacy without compromising on flexibility. Indeed, because of its use of the Bitcoin codebase, it can interact with :term:`smart contract <smart contract>`s and powerful decentralized applications (i.e., Particl Marketplace, :term:`BasicSwap <BasicSwap>` DEX), granting them more privacy at the same time.

Particl's Bitcoin Origins
-------------------------

PART is based on the latest version of the Bitcoin code (currently |BTC Version|) on top of which several improvements and adjustments have been made. This makes it a faster, more private, and more flexible version of Bitcoin.

One of the major benefits of being built on the Bitcoin codebase is the ability for Particl contributors to leverage the large Bitcoin developer pool and tap into their body of work. This allows for useful products (Particl Copay, Particl Electrum), protocols (Taproot, Lightning Network), and other improvements and updates to be easily adapted to work with Particl without having to build everything from scratch.

Another significant benefit relates to the security of users. Bitcoin being the most battle-tested blockchain out there, it has passed the test of time and countless stress testing, succeeding at protecting user funds over time. Leveraging the Bitcoin codebase and the ever-ongoing work of its developer community transposes its security benefits to Particl users.
