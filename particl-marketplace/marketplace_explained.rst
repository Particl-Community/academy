Technicals in a Nutshell
------------------------

This historical feat is made possible thanks to a novel combination of bleeding edge technologies. It allows you to do e-commerce without middlemen, restrictions, or fees. This historical breakthrough in global commerce

:term:`Particl Marketplace` is a privacy-first decentralized application of the Particl ecosystem. It combines usage of the Particl Blockchain with the :term:`SecureMessaging <SecureMessaging (SMSG)>` P2P network (SMSG) to enable private payments, communications, security, and privacy capabilities that do not require human intervention or trust in a third-party. 

Particl Blockchain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`Particl Blockchain` is a decentralized, immutable, and censorship-proof ledger that is privacy-oriented. It is built around the latest version of Bitcoin, but its code has been thoroughly enhanced by Particl contributors to provide a more robust level of privacy and more flexibility for use in decentralized applications like Particl Marketplace. 

The :term:`Particl Blockchain` validates and processes all financial transactions using its native and untraceable digital currency, PART. This disintermediates all transactions on the :term:`Particl Marketplace` — allowing for truly global and borderless payments — and makes them private by default.

The PART Coin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PART is the native :term:`cryptocurrency <Cryptocurrency>` of the :term:`Particl blockchain <Particl Blockchain>`. It is a privacy coin that, unlike other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, retains a high level of flexibility and :term:`smart contract <smart contract>` compatibility. This allows PART to be used in various dApps like Particl Marketplace and grants them advanced privacy capabilities not possible otherwise. 

It uses several security, encryption, and privacy protocols that are open-source and can be freely reviewed by anyone. This ensures none of your personal information and data can be collected when transacting on the :term:`cryptocurrency <Particl Marketplace>`. Learn why it matters here. 

What does the blockchain do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Particl Blockchain and its native privacy coin, PART, process all the financial-related activities of the marketplace’s users. 

* **Private transactions** — it processes transactions that are anonymous without involving any third-party (i.e., a payment processor).
* **Online escrow** — it enables two participants that do not know each other to protect their transactions using a two-party online escrow system.
* **User identity** — it provides users with identities that can be used to recognize users and build trust.
* **Content moderation** — it powers the marketplace’s moderation system by using coin balances as moderation power.

Every component of the Particl Marketplace is open-source, meaning that anyone can inspect the code and contribute to its development.

The SecureMessaging (SMSG protocol)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`SecureMessaging (SMSG)` network is Particl’s own custom-built and unique P2P messaging network that stands at the very core of its ecosystem. Inspired by the BitMessage protocol, the SMSG network is a mixnet that acts as a decentralized storage network (DSN). It stores and transfers data across :term:`nodes <node>` in a privacy-preserving manner, encrypted from end to end (E2EE), and without requiring the use of any central server.

SMSG processes all the non-financial data related to the marketplace — such as listing, order, and marketplace content information — and securely broadcasts it to the rest of the network in a peer-to-peer fashion and using strong end-to-end encryption. This avoids bloating the blockchain with excessive data and leaving permanent records.


What does SMSG do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SMSG is a key back-end component that makes Particl Marketplace and its groundbreaking benefits possible. It makes possible the following:

* **Listing information** — it stores and broadcasts listing information to the network.
* **Order information** — it processes orders and communicates trade data between two participants.
* **User communication** — it allows two participants to safely and privately communicate.
* **Content moderation** — it broadcasts the moderation preferences of each user to the rest of the network.

Access Gateways
---------------

Access gateways refer to any platform used by the end-user to access and use the Particl Marketplace. It is, in other words, the graphical interface of the application.

Because Particl Marketplace is, at its core, an open e-commerce protocol, it is possible to access and use it with a variety of access gateways. 

Gateways, each with pros and cons, may display things differently or provide a different set of features. But because they each connect to the same protocol, all gateways are cross-compatible with each other, meaning users do not need to be using the same gateway to trade with one another.
 
Particl Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Particl Desktop` is Particl’s most popular desktop client. It lets you manage your Particl :term:`cryptocurrency` wallets, as well as use the marketplace through an easy-to-use and intuitive interface. It is currently the only available access gateway, with others in development.

If you want to buy or sell an item, browse its listings and markets, leave a comment, or just about do anything on the :term:`Particl Marketplace`, Particl Desktop is what you need.
