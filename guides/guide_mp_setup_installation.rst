.. rst-class:: achievement

	Congratulations! You have installed :term:`Particl Marketplace`.

.. hint::

	**Loading and Syncing Times**

	Because the :term:`Particl Marketplace`'s content is hosted on distributed Networks for payments and exchange of data, the marketplace may take a few minutes to sync. It may take even a few more minutes to load all marketplace listings fully. This is to be normally expected and will get much faster as the Particl team improves the marketplace. If you open the :guilabel:`Market` > :guilabel:`Browse` module, keep an eye on the :guilabel:`Refresh` button. As soon as a counter appears new listings have arrived. Click on it to refresh the listings display.

Checksum verification
---------------------

Obtain the checksum code from the official download sources for the downloaded file. Each file has its own checksum. 

Being your own bank with blockchain-related products shifts some responsibilities to you. One of them is to take security seriously. Please make sure that the file you've downloaded isn't compromised in any way by verifying its checksum.

.. tabs::
	 .. group-tab:: Windows

	 	**Checksum verification command with terminal**

	 	.. rst-class:: bignums

	 		#. Open :guilabel:`Windows Explorer`
	 		#. Press :kbd:`SHIFT ⇧` + :kbd:`MOUSE-RIGHT ◳` on the Download folder and choose :guilabel:`Open command window here` or :guilabel:`Open power shell here`.
	 		#. Type the following command into the terminal while changing :file:`filename` for the real and complete filename of the downloaded file and hit :kbd:`ENTER ↵`.

	 			.. code-block:: bash

	 				CertUtil -hashfile filename SHA256

	 .. group-tab:: Mac

	 	**Checksum verification command with terminal**

	 	.. tip::
	 		**Prerequisite**: Head into :guilabel:`System Preferences` and select :guilabel:`Keyboard` > :guilabel:`Shortcuts` > :guilabel:`Services`. Find :guilabel:`New Terminal at Folder` in the settings and enable the checkbox.

		.. rst-class:: bignums

	 		#. Open :guilabel:`Finder`
	 		#. Press :kbd:`MOUSE-RIGHT ◳` on the Download folder of the file and you're shown the :guilabel:`services` > :guilabel:`open terminal` command to open the terminal at this location. 
			#. Type the following command into the terminal while changing :file:`filename` for the real filename of the downloaded file.

				.. code-block:: bash

					shasum -a 256 filename

	 .. group-tab:: Linux

	 	**Checksum verification command with terminal**

	 	.. rst-class:: bignums

	 		#.  Open a terminal in the Download-folder of the file and type the following command by changing :file:`filename` for the real filename of the downloaded file. 
	 	
	 			.. code-block:: bash

	 				sha256sum filename

Once that is done, compare the checksum output you've received in the step above with the checksum stated in the official download sources. The screenshot below shows you an example of this checksum highlighted from the GitHub release notes :guilabel:`Verification` section.

.. figure:: ../_static/media/images/mp_installation_github_checksum_verification.png

Backup Account and Data
=======================

File locations
--------------

After a successful installation of :term:`Particl Desktop`, the main application has been installed into the standard location of your operating system. Once the :term:`Particl Desktop` is run the first time, it will create user-specific data within your user account. These include settings, log files, wallets, and the blockchain data itself. From time to time, it is a reasonable measure to backup these data to an encrypted external resource.

.. tabs::
	 .. group-tab:: Windows

	 	.. code-block:: bash

	 		## Windows paths

	 		"%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Particl"

Install Tor (Network Privacy)
=============================

.. attention::

	The *only* privacy setting not turned on by default is the ability to keep your IP address anonymous when using Particl. This is done by routing your client's connection through Tor, a networking protocol designed to anonymize your IP address.

.. danger::
	
	Always make sure your :term:`Tor` is up-to-date with the latest version. This is a critical requirement that, if not followed, can heavily compromise your online privacy and potentially let other people spy on your online activity.

	:term:`Tor` isn't enabled by default on Particl because it requires extra care from you to be truly safe. It's a network that runs independently from Particl on your computer and needs you to keep critical security considerations in mind. 

To make sure you don't download a compromised version of Tor, always download it from their official website. What good would updating :term:`Tor` do to you if it lets the door wide open to hackers? To avoid any `man-in-the-middle-attack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack>`_, always verify the cryptographic signature of the :term:`Tor` files you download, even if it's from Tor's official website. To do so, follow this tutorial on `how to verify Tor signatures <https://support.torproject.org/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/>`_ written by the :term:`Tor` team itself.	

The :term:`Tor` network can be installed using three different methods. Always make sure that, regardless of the installation method you choose, :term:`Tor` is running the latest version before using it.

Using the Tor browser
---------------------

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Download the `Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/download/>`_ and install it on your computer.
	#. Launch the :term:`Tor` browser.
	#. Connect to the :term:`Tor` network by clicking on :guilabel:`Connect` or configure your connection parameters by clicking on :guilabel:`Configure`.
	#. Once connected, leave the :term:`Tor` Browser running in the background of your computer.


Using the Tor daemon
--------------------

.. tabs::

	.. group-tab:: Windows

		.. rst-class:: bignums

	 		#. Download the `Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/download/>`_ and install it on your computer.
	 		#. Open :guilabel:`Windows Explorer` and navigate to the :term:`Tor` installation directory (e.g., :file:`C:\/Program Files\/Tor Browser`).
			#. Go into the :file:`Tor` directory, hold down :kbd:`SHIFT ⇧` and click with :kbd:`MOUSE-RIGHT ◳`.
			#. Open :guilabel:`Open command window here` from the menu.

Enable Tor on Particl Desktop
-----------------------------

Enable :term:`Tor` support for :term:`Particl Desktop` with the proper proxy instructions. Either you add a special argument to the command you use to launch :term:`Particl Desktop`, or you make it a permanent setting.

Enable by default from GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open :term:`Particl Desktop` and click on :guilabel:`Particl Desktop Settings` in the bottom left corner
	#. Go to :guilabel:`Core network connection` and put into the :guilabel:`Connect via Proxy` field :code:`127.0.0.1:9150` if you are using the Tor Browser OR :code:`127.0.0.1:9050` if you are using the Tor daemon
	#. Hit :guilabel:`Save changes` and restart :term:`Particl Desktop`

Enable by default from commandline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open the configuration file: 

		.. code-block:: bash

			nano ~/.particl/particl.conf

	#. If you are using Tor Browser add this line to the configuration file:

		.. code-block:: bash

				type the following command if you are using Tor daemon.
		
				.. code-block:: bash

					./Particl\ Desktop -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050		


Using Tor as a Hidden Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Linux, you can also run :term:`Tor` as a hidden service and connect your :term:`Particl Desktop` to it. This allows other people to use your :term:`node <Node>` as an entry or exit point, making the :term:`Tor` network more :term:`decentralized <Decentralization>` and private.

.. rst-class:: bignums

	#. Open a :guilabel:`Terminal` and install the :term:`Tor` network by typing: 
	
		.. code-block:: bash

			sudo apt-get install tor

	#. Define that you want to use :term:`Tor` as a hidden service by modifying the :term:`Tor` config file. To do so, type: 

		.. code-block:: bash

			sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

		In the config file, add these two lines:

		.. code-block:: bash

			HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/particl-service/
			HiddenServicePort 51738 127.0.0.1:51738

		Save and exit the nano file editor by pressing :kbd:`CTRL+c`, then type :kbd:`y` followed by :kbd:`ENTER ↵` to save the changes.

	#. Restart :term:`Tor` by typing into the terminal 
	
		.. code-block:: bash
		
			sudo service tor restart

	#. Find your hidden service’s IP address (.onion) by typing (For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll refer to this address as :code:`[yourexternalip].onion`):
	
		.. code-block:: bash

			sudo cat /var/lib/tor/particl-service/hostname

	#. Modify your Particl config file to route its connection through your hidden service by typing: 

		.. code-block:: bash

			touch ~/.particl/particl.conf && nano ~/.particl/particl.conf

		Then add these lines to the file and don`t forget to set :code:`yourexternalip.onion` 

		.. code-block:: bash
	
			externalip=[yourexternalip].onion
			onion=127.0.0.1:9050
			addnode=7vusex6gv5eerqi2.onion
			addnode=quf7tm4gk3xn3aee.onion
			addnode=46fvsrrq75dx5vq4.onion
			addnode=ciikdjtoop7l6p6h.onion

			addnode=kfyopkn3shigcneh.onion
			onlynet=tor
			listen=1
			bind=127.0.0.1:51738
			maxconnections=30

		Save and exit the nano file editor by pressing :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`c`, then type :kbd:`y` followed by :kbd:`ENTER ↵` to save the changes.

Important Considerations
------------------------

Keep Tor up-to-date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Tor` needs to always be updated to the latest version. This is a critical requirement that, if not followed, can heavily compromise your online privacy. :term:`Tor` updates contain very important security fixes to keep your identity confidential. 

As the network itself is widely targeted by hackers due to the privacy it provides, unpatched versions of :term:`Tor` are considered unsafe to use. If exploited, a compromised version of :term:`Tor` may leak your true identity and even let others spy on your online activity.

.. tabs::
	 .. group-tab:: Windows

	 	**Updating Tor**

	 	.. rst-class:: bignums

	 		#. Open the :term:`Tor` Browser

	 		#. Type this line of code and  hit :kbd:`ENTER ↵`

	 			.. code-block:: bash
	
	 				brew update && brew upgrade

	 .. group-tab:: Linux

	 	**Updating Tor**

	 	.. rst-class:: bignums

	 		#. Open a :guilabel:`Terminal` and run the upgrade procedure depending on your package manager.

	 			**Example**

	 			.. code-block:: bash

	 				sudo apt update && sudo apt-upgrade

	 	Depending on your linux flavor this command may vary. There are multiple package-managers out there, but their usage is quite the same.
