Markets & Storefronts

      :description lang=en: Own your own storefront for free. Particl's Markets & Storefronts enables you to setup an infinite number of marketplaces for goods and services. Thanks to blockchain technology.

The difference between markets and a storefronts is about their publishing rights. A market is open to list items for everyone, in a storefront only to those who do have the publishing key. 

.. note::

   To simplify the terminology, "markets" and "storefronts" are referred to as "community markets".

Create and join an infinite number of community markets with |PM|. Each of these markets can host an infinite number of listings and live independently from the predefined :term:`Open Market`.

By default, a community market isn’t publicly visible and is only known to its creator. However, a community market can be promoted within the :term:`Market Browser`, making it available to join at the click of a button. Of course, you can grant direct access as well.

Create a Community Market
-------------------------

These four steps ain't hard and can make you start a new business.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets` and click on the :guilabel:`Create new Market` button to start the market creation process.
  #. Enter a title, a short description, a picture for your market, and then choose the region your market targets (can be worldwide). 
  #. Select the :guilabel:`Community Market` or :guilabel:`Storefront` option depending on your preference.
  #. Click on :guilabel:`Confirm & Create Market` to review the details of your market.

Your community market is now created. You can promote it to the Market Browser so that anyone can easily access it or keep its Market ID and Access Key private. Doing that will let you share the access information to only the people you want to. 

.. attention::

   Anyone with access to the Publish Key (Storefont) can share it with anyone else. Only share the Publish Key to people you trust and know won't leak it out.

**Publish Listings**

To publish listings to your new community market, go through the normal :doc:`product listing process <../guides/guide_mp_vendor_understanding_sellflow>` and choose your community market when ready to publish your item(s). 

Promote a Market
------------------

Make your community market publicly visible in the :term:`Market Browser` and let anyone in the world join it and purchase items. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets`.
  #. Click on the tile of the market you want to promote and click on the :guilabel:`Promote in Market Browser` icon at the bottom of the expanded tile to open the market promotion window.
  #. Select the number of days you want to promote your market for and confirm with a click on :guilabel:`Promote Market` to promote it.

.. hint::

 Anyone is able and free to promote a market on their own behalf.

Browse the Markets
------------------

Explore and join all the community markets that have been promoted by their creators or other community members. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #.  Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Browser`.
  #. Browse the publicly accessible community markets and find one you want to join.
  #. Click on its tile to expand its options and click on :guilabel:`Join this Market` to connect to it.

.. hint::

 #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets` to see all the markets you have joined.
 #. You can browse the market's listings by :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`BROWSE` and selecting the community market in the :guilabel:`FILTER` section.

Join a Market
-------------

If you have in your possession the Market ID and Access/Publish Key of a certain community market, you can directly join it even if it's not promoted on the Market Browser. If you only have the Access Key of a storefront, you will only be able to buy items. If you instead possess its Publish Key, then you'll be able to join as a full vendor and also publish and sell items. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. First, make sure that you possess the Market ID and Market Access Key of the market/storefront you want to join. You may need to collect this information from private sources if they are not publicly broadcast by its creator or users.
  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Browser` and click on the :guilabel:`Join via Market ID` button to expand the window to join a new market.
  #. Fill the community market's information. This information can be entirely decided by you to help you better organize your markets and know what they're about.
  #. Enter the community market's Market ID and Access/Publish Key, and then click on the :guilabel:`Join this Market` button to join the community market.

.. hint::

 #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets` to see all the markets you have joined.
 #. You can browse the market's listings by :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`BROWSE` and selecting the community market in the :guilabel:`FILTER` section.
