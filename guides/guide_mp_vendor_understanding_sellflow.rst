Publish Items
-------------

.. attention::

   To put an item for sale on Particl, you need to have PART coins in your :guilabel:`Public` or :guilabel:`Anon` balance so that you can pay for the listing fees. Funds in your :guilabel:`Anon` balance are also required to make security deposits into escrow contracts (which are equal to the value of any item purchased by a buyer).

.. hint::
  
    **Wallet Unlocking**

    To receive orders or to complete order steps, your :term:`Particl Desktop` client needs to be unlocked. You will not receive any order or get notifications on the progress of active orders if you keep your wallet locked. For this reason, make sure the padlock icon at the top-right corner of the status bar is unlocked.

To make a sale on Particl, you need to first put items up for sale. There are many ways to create listings on Particl. The right way for you depends on your requirements.

Publish a Single Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only want to list a single item, then simply follow these steps.

Create a listing template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`SELL` -> :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` followed by the :guilabel:`New` button.
  #. Fill up all the text boxes with the information on your listing and upload an (or multiple) image of your product or service.

If you want to publish now
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  #. Click on :guilabel:`Publish right away` tile to select which market you want to publish your listing and set the correct category for your item accordingly.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Save and Publish` button and choose the duration time for the item's listing.

.. hint::
  After one (1) blockchain confirmation (approximately 2 minutes), your listing will be live on the previously selected market(s).

If you want to publish it later
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of publishing your listing immediately, you can save its template for later. When creating your listing template, instead of clicking on :guilabel:`Save and Publish`, you can click on the :guilabel:`Save` button to save your listing template and publish it later instead of right now.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`SELL` -> :guilabel:`Inventory & Products`, locate your saved listing, and click on its tile to expand the details. Its status will show as :guilabel:`Listing unpublished`.
  #. You can still edit the listing by clicking on the  :guilabel:`Edit` button or publish it by clicking the :guilabel:`Publish` icon (rocket).
  #. You can also publish your listing in other community markets or storefronts by clicking on the green :guilabel:`Clone Product to Market` button and selecting which market (and category) you want to add your listing template to. 
  #. Choose the amount of time you want your listing to show up on the new market and click on :guilabel:`Publish Listing`.

.. hint::
  After one (1) blockchain confirmation (approximately 2 minutes) your listing will be live on the previously selected market(s).

If you want to publish on multiple markets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also publish your listing on multiple community markets and storefronts. This option is only available if you have joined additional markets with publishing rights.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`SELL` -> :guilabel:`Inventory & Products`, locate the listing you want to publish on other community markets, and click on its tile to expand the details.
  #. Click on the green :guilabel:`Clone Product to Market` button and select which market (and category) you want to add your listing template to. 
  #. Choose the amount of time you want your listing to show up on the new market and click on :guilabel:`Publish Listing`.

.. hint::
  After one (1) blockchain confirmation (approximately 2 minutes), your listing will be live on the previously selected market(s). From this moment, a new market will be connected to your listing template. Repeat these steps for all community markets you want to publish your listing on.

Publish Multiple Items at Once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are selling multiple items, then you may want to create a CSV inventory file and list all of your products at once. This will save you the time of listing each item one-by-one. 

Publishing multiple listings at once is separated into two steps: (1) creating listing templates and (2) publishing them.

Create listing templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step of the process is to import your inventory into :term:`Particl Desktop` using a CSV file and create a listing template for each item.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`SELL` -> :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` followed by a click on the :guilabel:`Import` button.
  #. To process your inventory, import your CSV file by clicking on the :guilabel:`Choose file` button of the :guilabel:`IMPORT FROM CSV FILE` section and click on the :guilabel:`Process CSV import` button.
  #. One listing template per item will be created. Review each template and, if needed, click on their tiles to expand and edit their details.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Import & Save` to create your listing templates.

.. tip::

 You can download a :file:`.csv` template file from the :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`SELL` -> :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` -> :guilabel:`Import` section after selecting :guilabel:`CSV file` as source.


(Re)Publish your listing templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second step of the process is to publish the listing templates you've just created.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`SELL` -> :guilabel:`Inventory & Products` followed by a click on the :guilabel:`Batch (Re)publish...` button.
  #. Click :guilabel:`PUBLISH TO` to select on which markets you want to publish your listings.
  #. Click :guilabel:`PUBLISH DURATION` to select for how long you want your listings to be available.
  #. Click their :guilabel:`Publish` checkboxes or hit :guilabel:`Select all` in the :guilabel:`SELECT...` dropdown menu to individually choose the items you want to publish.  
  #. Click on :guilabel:`Publish selected products` and wait for :term:`Particl Desktop` to publish your listings. A progress bar at the bottom of the screen indicates the progress.

.. Import WooCommerce Inventory
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If you are already selling online, more specifically on WooCommerce, then you can simply export your products into a Particl compatible CSV inventory file by following `this WooCommerce tutorial <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/product-csv-importer-exporter/>`_. Once that is done, you can then easily import the CSV inventory file on Particl by following the simple steps that follow.

    Until automatic fiat rates are supported on Particl, it is required to convert the quoted prices of your WooCommerce products into PART prices. If you want to sell your products for USD and the USD/PART price is $5, then simply type ``5``. Keep in mind these prices do not adjust automatically, which means you'll have to edit that line every time you re-publish your products.

  .. rst-class:: bignums

  #. In the :guilabel:`SELECT IMPORT SOURCE` section, select :guilabel:`WooCommerce`.
  #. Click on the :guilabel:`Woocommerce export file` line and import your WooCommerce CSV inventory file.
